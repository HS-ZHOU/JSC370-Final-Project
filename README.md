# JSC370 Project: Finding variables that affect the academic performance of K-12 schools and an analysis of the associations

## Project Description

Education is one of the fundamental building blocks of any society and plays a vital role in shaping the future of individuals, communities, and nations. Among all years in school, k-12 education has the most significant influence on students because their personality and vision of the world are primarily shaped in elementary and secondary schools. Factors such as the school's suspension rate, drop rate, number of students, full-time educators, and geographic locations can partially reflect a school's academic performance. For example, suspension rates in primary and secondary schools are of concern as they are associated with adverse outcomes such as reduced academic performance, increased dropout rates, and a higher likelihood of involvement in delinquent behavior. On the other hand, other factors like the teacher-student ratio can suggest how many school resources and attention teachers each student can get. Thus a smaller ratio might imply a higher academic performance of a school board. Hence, from these factors, we can analyze their impacts on a school's academic performance, and understanding the relationship between them is crucial for policymakers, educators, and stakeholders in designing effective strategies to improve educational outcomes.

With this in mind, I want to investigate the following question: What factors of a school will influence their academic performance and their relationships? To be more specific, what are the relationships between each school board's academic performance and their suspension rate, drop rate, number of students, number of full-time educators, and geographic locations?

The data I obtained to answer the questions is from 
[Ontario public data website](https://www.ontario.ca/page/government-ontario) and 
[Open Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en.html) searching with keyword _school board_. The datasets contain information about all public schools, including elementary and secondary schools, in Ontario. All datasets I can find are from 2015 to 2019, so I will also limit my scope to this range.
